## CustomCore

CustomCore is a server modification for CustomWorld, a Minecraft server located in Europe. Made by ThomasQM (Co-Founder of CustomWorld) and xCustomWorld (Founder of CustomWorld).

CustomCore is mainly made in Scala with bit of Java code. It's implented to be able to run on a Spigot server with version 1.12.2. Other versions haven't been tested yet, but will likely work. CustomCore depends on third party plugins: FastAsyncWorldEdit and CoreProtect. 

CustomCore contains basic moderation commands, such as /mute, /kick, /tempban etc... but it still expands with alot of new stuff. It supports popular minigames such as Spleef and BoatRace. However, minigames are still in development, they are working fine, but they still need alot testing. CC (CustomCore) was specially made for Minecraft server CustomWorld located at **customworld.mine.gg**.
